# DR Project Stub

This is a small collection of files I use to configure neovim for a new DragonRuby project.

- .gitignore - Basic gitignore for clean commits when upgrading dr versions
- .rgignore - RipGrep config to remove noisy directories from grep search within vim
- .solargraph.yml - solargraph config to quiet down/turn off rubocop
